## 3.2.1 Environments
As a simple example, consider the following code containing nested lambda expressions:
```scheme
((lambda (a b)
    ((lambda (c)
        ((lambda (d e f) body) 3 4 5))
    2))
0 1)
```
the environment looks like:
```scheme
(((d e f) . (3 4 5))
  ((c) . (2))
  ((a b) . (0 1)))
```
The improvement described in Section 3.4 allows the variable ribs to be dropped from the environment structure; the environment becomes a list of value ribs.

## 3.2.2 Frames and the Control Stack
Frames are used to record the state of a pending computation while performing another.

They are most often created when one function calls another.

Call frames are used throughout this chapter and the next, and the particular format varies from model to model.

However, a call frame must always contain a "return address" or expression to be evaluated next, the environment or equivalent description of the active variable bindings, a pointer to the previous frame, and any other state required to continue the computation.

### In the heap-based system, call frames are simply lists that contain four fields
- The first field is **the expression field**.
  - This field determines the next expression to be evaluated.
  - It corresponds to a return address (saved program counter or instruction counter) in a standard computer architecture.
- The second field is **the environment field**.
  - This contains the currently active environment.
- The third field is **the rib field**.
  - During the evaluation of an application, this field contains a list of the arguments that have been evaluated so far.
- The fourth and final field holds **the next frame**.

The control stack in a heap-based system is the linked structure of the current frame, the previous frame, its previous frame, and so on.

**It resembles a linked list, where the fields of each frame are the elements and linking is internal through the "next frame" pointer.**

It is reasonable to structure the control stack so that the links are external to the frames as long as no extra storage overhead or overhead in following links is introduced.
