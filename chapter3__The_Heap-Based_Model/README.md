# The Heap-Based Model
- [The first section](./3.1_motivation-and-problems.md) of this chapter describes the motivation behind and the problems with the heap-based model.
- The second section presents the data structures needed to support the heap-based model
- The third describes the operation of this model.
- The fourth section: compiler that generates code for the heap-based model and a virtual machine that specifies how this code is executed.
- The fifth section presents a common improvement that substantially cuts the execution overhead of most programs
  - and presents a modified compiler and virtual machine that serve as a basis for those presented in the following chapter.
