# 3.4 Implementing the Heap-Based Model

## 3.4.1 Assembly Code
### The assembly code for the VM described in this section consists of **12 instructions** each with zero or more operands. The instructions are described below.
- **(halt)**
    - halts the virtual machine.
    - The value in the accumulator is the result of the computation.
- **(refer var x)**
    - finds the value of the variable var in the current environment
    - places this value into the accumulator
    - sets the next expression to x.
- **(constant obj x)**
    - places obj into the the accumulator and sets the next expression to x.
- **(close vars body x )**
    - creates a closure from body, vars and the current environment
    - places the closure into the accumulator
    - sets the next expression to x.
- **(test then else)**
    - tests the accumulator and if the accumulator is nonnull (that is, the test returned true)
    - sets the next expression to then
    - Otherwise test sets the next expression to else.
- **(assign var x)**
    - changes the current environment binding for the variable var to the value in the accumulator
    - sets the next expression to x.
- **(conti x)**
    - creates a continuation from the current stack, places this continuation in the accumulator
    - sets the next expression to x.
- **(nuate s var)**
    - restores s to be the current stack, sets the accumulator to the value of var in the current environment
    - sets the next expression to **(return)** (see below).
- **(frame x ___ret___ )**
    - creates a new frame from the current environment, the current rib, and ___ret___ as the next expression
    - adds this frame to the current stack
    - sets the current rib to the empty list
    - sets the next expression to x.
- **(argument x)**
    - adds the value in the accumulator to the current rib
    - sets the next expression to x.
- **(apply)**
    - applies the closure in the accumulator to the list of values in the current rib.
    - Precisely this instruction
        - extends the closure’s environment with the closure’s variable list and the current rib
        - sets the current environment to this new environment
        - sets the current rib to the empty list
        - sets the next expression to the closure’s body.
- **(return)**
    - removes the first frame from the stack
    - resets the current environment, the current rib, the next expression, and the current stack.
